# Data Modeling
Conducting data analysis to understand the patterns, trends, and factors influencing blood pressure frequency, stress levels, and sleep disturbances. This approach involves summarizing and discovering insights from data exploration without physically requesting any symptoms from the patient.

# Data Visualization
Health and Lifestyle Interactive Dashboard were created Using Tableau, These visualization helps to show the distribution, frequency correlation and trends of different variables such as age, gender, occupation,  blood pressure , BMI, Stress level, daily steps, physical activity and sleeping duration.

# Analysis
Using descriptive Analysis, comparative analysis which is simply comparing and contrasting different groups and catergories like minimium and maximium daily steps of each profession, exploring the relationship between physical activity and sleep duration. i also used correlational analysis which is measuring and testing the body mass index of the relationship between two or more variables such as stress level and blood pressure to determine if there is any relation impactation. In addstion, Abnormal blood frequecy per profession were actualized.
